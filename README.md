# Story Map Journal Generator

The Story Map Journal is ideal when you want to combine narrative text with maps and other embedded content. 

The typical Map Journal creation process involve using a WYSIWYG builder. That repository let you generate a Map Journal through a simple JSON document, without using the builder.

The resulting application is hosted in ArcGIS Online, you can edit it later as if you had used the builder.
